This is the first data analysis project that I'm working on. The ideia is to model UNO computationaly and simulate it, having as purpose analysing the results and answer questions as: 
```quote
"Does the initial cards have a impact in who will win the game?"
```
```quote
"How much impact has UNO players strategies in game's result?"
```
