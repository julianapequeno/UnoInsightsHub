This is the first data analysis project that I'm working on. The ideia is to model UNO computationaly and simulate it, having as purpose analysing the results and answer questions as: 
```quote
"Does the initial cards have a impact in who will win the game?"
```
```quote
"How much impact has UNO players strategies in game's result?"
```

### BRANCHES

- [main](https://github.com/julianasantiago100/uno_simulation/tree/main) - This branch contains the main source code for now. It's the best and the stable version of UNO SIMULATION.
- [data_analysis_pythonic](https://github.com/julianasantiago100/uno_simulation/tree/data_analysis_pythonic) - This branch contains a data analysis notebook and it is designed for feed the dataset.
- [playerstrategyone](https://github.com/julianasantiago100/uno_simulation/tree/playerstrategyone) - This branch contains the beggining of development of the player strategy class.
