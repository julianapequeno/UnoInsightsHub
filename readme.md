`UnoInsightsHub` is a computational simulation project made in Python that consists in a model of the famous worldwide game, UNO, applied to some statistical studies. Therefore, it enabled the extraction of important information and insights out of the endless possibilities of playing and winning the game.
<br>
For this reason, in this project it was developed an IA that plays UNO and the game's machine itself.

- Version 1.0 updates!!ðŸ“°[(here)](#version-updates)

## How to Use

In this session, I will show you how you can run this version of `UnoInsightsHub`.
Firstly, this version is the `model` itself. That is, here I implemented a script to be shown when the user run the code. Then, you will be able to see what's happening under the covers.

<div align='center'>
<i> ðŸŒŸ make sure you have python3 installed :)</i>
</div><br>

First clone this repository.

```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/julianasantiago100/UnoInsightsHub.git
```

Change the branch to `model`.

```cmd
   git checkout model
```

Then, with the project opened in your local environment, type the following commands in our prompt.

```python
   cd src/
```

```python
   python3 UNOMODEL.py
```

Now, you will be able to see the script and interact with the program!ðŸ˜Š

## Version Updates

<i> Version 1.0 - November 2023</i><br>
The currently version only has one player strategy implemented. For future features, I'd like to add other strategies and more UNO rules applied.

## Development

#### ðŸ“Œ Pre-requisites

To be able to run the project, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed: <br>

- Python3
- Git

#### Choosing your development environment

For run this project, you should choose whether you want to run it on a local or a remote environment. Some advices:

- If you are aiming to test only the `UNO MODEL` I suggest you taking the local environment. But of course, only if you feel comfortable.
- If your goal is to run and see data analysis of the model. I suggest you trying an remote environment, like
  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index). Due to the high complexity of the algorithm, you computer may not be the best resource to use :(
  - This is a specific advice to run the following notebook: [UNOInsightsHub-Data](data_analysis\notebook\notebook.ipynb). You can find more information about that on `data_analysis` folder.

    Before you get to try and test the model, you should follow some steps to have everything you need in hand. <br>
    <br>
ðŸ¦„ Firstly, make sure you have <code>Git</code> installed. Everything is right? Okay! Now here's a recommended step-by-step to install the dependencies: <br> <Br>

1. Clone the repository

   `git clone https://github.com/julianasantiago100/uno_simulation.git`

2. Install python3, pandas, jupyter notebook, numpy and matplotlib
   - Depending on your Operational System,the command line will be different.
